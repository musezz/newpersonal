            <h1>GUCCI</h1>
            <p>Its quite certain that when Guccio Gucci started out, he never dreamed that his small luggage company would grow to one carrying such cultural significance.</p> 
            <p>But since Gucci was founded in Florence in 1921, the company has built a catalog of genuinely iconic trademarks.</p>
            <p>The interlocking GG logo; the bar-and-bit belt buckle; the bamboo-handle handbag; the omnipresent loafer all of them have helped the brand penetrate mainstream culture like no other Italian label in history.</p>
